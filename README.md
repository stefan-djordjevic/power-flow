POWER FLOW CALCULATION OF DISTRIBUTION NETWORK

Given tasks are done in FORTRAN and C++.

IDE Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 is used to develop this project. 
Solution consists of the following:

C++_DLL_Project – as Dynamic-Link Library (.dll)

FORTRAN_Project – as Console Application (main project; depends on C++_DLL_Project;)

The project was completed with the documentation (pdf file) covering theoretical basics on which the task in the project is based. 
The documentation contains an attachment with the input data presented in external files, also. 
The implementation of the program itself involves the implementation of most a feature of Fortran and C++ programming languages.

THE TASK IN SHORT:
For a given distribution network, the program provides power flow calculation using a specialized current summing algorithm, 
better known as the “Shirmohammadi algorithm”. The calculation network is a 20kV radial distribution network given in the Figure 1.1.
